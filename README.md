# GoLang

## Setup

1. Install : https://go.dev/doc/install
2.

## Features

1. Concurrency
2. Go Routines
3. Statically Typed
4. Fast Compilation Times : efficient compiler design
5. Efficient String Processing
6. Comprehensive Set Of String Functions
7. Uses Garbage Collection
8. Go = C + Strings + Garbage Collection + Concurrency
9. Lightweight

## Theory

1. GO is a concurrent programming language
2. Is is statically typed : which means each variable has a type defined at compile time, that cannot be changed over time
3. Concurrency : It refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks independently but not necessarily simultaneously
4. Go Routine : It is a lightweight thread managed by Go Runtime
5. Lightweight : ALl the tools Go uses consume very less memory
